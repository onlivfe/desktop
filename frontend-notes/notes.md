## hurdles

- managing multiple user profiles/identities, with multiple accounts
- multiple accounts for a single user
  - SOLUTION: create "mappings", which can be shared, and are not tied to a unique id globally
  - if there is a sync/someone updates a mapping from someone else
    - check existing user ids when there is a profile sync push
    - ask the user if they want to overwrite
- using an account on multiple computers/vms
